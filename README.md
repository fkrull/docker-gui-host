# docker-gui-host â€“ a GUI-enabled Docker host VM
This Vagrant VM configuration is set up for experimenting with Docker images
with GUIs, by being a VM config running Docker and also having the GUI enabled
for Virtualbox. See for example
[my own attempts](https://hub.docker.com/r/fkrull/desktop-base).

## Usage
Start the VM:
```
vagrant up
```
The `vagrant` user can run Docker without `sudo`. The Docker daemon is also
exposed on the host's port 2376. To tell your local Docker client to
connect to the VM's daemon, either specify the `-H` parameter:
```
docker -H tcp://localhost:2376 ...
```
or by setting the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to `tcp://localhost:2376`.

A [Portainer instance](https://portainer.io) is running at
http://localhost:9000. The VM can also transparently run non-amd64 binaries,
using the
[fkrull/qemu-user-static](https://hub.docker.com/r/fkrull/qemu-user-static)
Docker image. This allows building and running foreign-architecture Docker
images, for example.
